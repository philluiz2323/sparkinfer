# Contributing to sparkinfer

sparkinfer is the engineering arm of **SN74 on Gittensor**. Contributions are rewarded
for **real, verified inference-speed engineering** — not benchmark gaming. This guide is
how to make a contribution that counts.

## Principles

- **Source-required & reproducible.** The validator builds your PR from source. No
  opaque prebuilt images — the shipped prebuilt binaries are a *run* convenience, not a
  submission format.
- **Correctness first.** A faster kernel that changes the model's output is worth zero.
  Every change is gated against a frozen reference (see *Accuracy gate* below).
- **General, not overfit.** Optimizations must hold across the basket — **Qwen3-MoE and
  Gemma 4** — and across shapes. A win on one model/shape but not the other is overfitting.
- **Blackwell only, by design.** Targets `sm_120` (RTX 5090, RTX PRO 6000) and `sm_121`
  (RTX Spark / Jetson Thor). CUDA 12.8+ (13 works). Not `sm_100`.

## Before you open a PR

```bash
# 1. build + tests (must be 5/5)
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120 && cmake --build build -j && ctest --test-dir build

# 2. speed — does it actually go faster?
bench/scripts/bench.sh --download            # and --compare for the llama.cpp gap

# 3. accuracy — did it stay correct?  (this is the gate that blocks regressions)
bench/scripts/accuracy.sh --download
```

**Accuracy gate.** Run `bench/scripts/accuracy.sh` (or `qwen3_gguf_score`) on the build
*before* and *after* your change. A correct optimization must keep:
- **≥ 99–100% top-1 token agreement** vs the previous build, and
- **mean KL ≈ 0** (the next-token distributions barely move).

(`accuracy.sh` also compares against llama.cpp; the implementation bar there is ≥ 90%
top-1, which we currently meet at 100%.) If `compute-sanitizer` is available, your kernels
must be clean (0 errors).

## How rewards work (SN74)

**Speedup-only.** You're paid for the **verified marginal speedup** your PR adds over the
current best ("frontier"), not your rank — so "copy the leader + ε" pays ≈ ε. The eval loop
labels each PR **XL / L / M / S / XS** from the measured delta (or **BASELINE** for the first
verified entry on a new model/target) — never by hand — and that tier is the payout. A speedup
is scored the same wherever it lands (`kernels/`, `runtime/`, `moe/`); there is **no
per-subsystem budget**. Tiers are maturity-adaptive (they rebalance toward smaller gains as the
runtime nears the hardware ceiling). See the [org reward model](https://github.com/gittensor-ai-lab).

**Non-speedup PRs are welcome — but score 0.** Bug fixes, refactors, tests, benchmarks, docs,
and tooling are appreciated and we'll review and merge good ones, but SN74 emits only for
verified speedups, so they earn no reward. (The eval/scoring harness is maintainer-owned — see
*Maintainer-owned paths* below.)

**Evaluation is opt-in — check the box.** The RTX 5090 eval runs only once the
**`- [x] Tested on RTX 5090`** box in the PR template is ticked. When it is, the bot greenlights
the PR (adds **`test-on-5090`**) and evaluates it on the next poll; until then it marks the PR
**`not-tested`** and does not evaluate. So fill in the template and tick the box when your PR is
ready to be measured. (A maintainer can also add the `test-on-5090` label manually.)

> ⚠️ Tick that box **only if you actually ran it on an RTX 5090** and pasted the benchmark log.
> Checking it without testing is false attestation — it is treated as gaming and the account will
> be **blocked** (added to the denylist), the same as copycatting or sybil farming.

## Maintainer-owned paths (eval, scoring & governance)

The evaluation harness and scoring config are **maintainer-owned** and must not be changed
in a contributor PR. They decide labels and emissions and are the trust anchor validators
rely on — so a change here, however well-intentioned, can't ride in on the same PR it would
score. These paths are protected:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `eval/` | the PR-evaluation bot + GPU runner |
| `bench/scripts/` | the on-box scoring harness (`evaluate.sh`, `label.py`, `accuracy*`, `_common.sh`, the eval prompt) |
| `.gittensor/` | intra-repo emission weights |
| `dashboard/data.json` | the live frontier ledger |
| `.github/` | CI, `CODEOWNERS`, and this guard |

**Enforcement.** A required **`sensitive-paths-guard`** check automatically fails any PR from a
non-maintainer that touches these paths, and `CODEOWNERS` requires maintainer review — so such
PRs **cannot merge**, regardless of content. The evaluator also grades with the harness pinned
to the protected branch, so editing it in a PR never affects that PR's own score.

**Improving the harness is welcome — just not via a direct PR.** Open an issue or discussion
describing the change; if a maintainer agrees, they'll land it (with credit). Keep your own PRs
scoped to `kernels/`, `runtime/`, and `moe/` — that's the rewarded optimization work.

## Style & scope

- Match the surrounding code (portable CUDA is the production path; CuTe/tensor-core is
  the opt-in ceiling). Keep kernels readable and commented where non-obvious.
- Reference the bench + accuracy numbers in your PR description (before → after).
- Keep changes focused; one optimization per PR makes the measured delta attributable.
